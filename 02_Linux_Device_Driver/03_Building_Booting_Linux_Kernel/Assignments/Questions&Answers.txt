1. Answer the following based on your current Linux system:

1. What is your current kernel version?
(Use uname -r)

6.8.0-84-generic


2. What files are present in /boot/ that relate to the kernel?

In /boot/, the kernel-related files are:

vmlinuz-* - the actual Linux kernel

initrd.img-* - temporary root filesystem with drivers

config-* - kernel build configuration

System.map-* - kernel symbol table



3. What folder(s) exist in /usr/src/? Can you see linux-source or linux-headers?

In /usr/src/ :

linux-headers-* - kernel header files

linux-source-* - full kernel source



4. What is the role of GRUB during boot?

GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) loads the kernel into memory and starts the boot process.

Lets you choose between multiple kernels or OSes.



5. What is vmlinuz?

vmlinuz is the compressed Linux kernel image that GRUB loads to start the OS.


6. Why is initramfs used?

initramfs (initial RAM filesystem) provides temporary drivers and tools needed to mount the real root filesystem during boot.


7. Why should you keep old kernels installed?

In case the new kernel fails to boot, you can select an older working kernel from GRUB.


8. What does make menuconfig do?

Opens a menu-based configuration tool to select kernel options before building it.

Lets you enable/disable drivers, features, and modules.


9. Pick one module, and search online to find out what it does?

joydev, lets your Linux system talk to joysticks and game controllers.

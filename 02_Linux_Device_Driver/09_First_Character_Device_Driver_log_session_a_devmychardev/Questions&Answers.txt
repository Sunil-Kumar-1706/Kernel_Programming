1.What is a major number? What is a minor number?

Major number: Tells the kernel which driver should handle operations for a device file.

Minor number: Tells the driver which specific device to operate on (useful if one driver manages multiple devices).





2.What does register_chrdev() do?

Registers your character device with the kernel.

Links your file_operations (open, read, write, close) with a major number.

If you pass 0 as major, the kernel assigns a free major number automatically.






3.What would happen if you don’t call unregister_chrdev() on exit?


If you don’t call it, the kernel still thinks your device exists ,which can cause crashes or resource leaks.





4.Why do we use copy_from_user() in write()?

Safely copies data from user-space memory to kernel-space memory.

Required because kernel cannot directly access user-space buffers.

Protects the kernel from invalid memory access.






5.Why is device_buffer[] important?

Stores data written by the user so it can be read back later.

Acts as temporary storage inside the kernel.

Without it, your driver would have no memory to hold the user’s input.

Find a folder like linux-source-* or linux-headers-*. Explore and answer:

1.What folders do you see inside?

Inside /usr/src/linux-headers-5.15.0-156 there is folders 
arch   certs   Documentation  fs       init      ipc     Kconfig  lib       mm   samples  security  tools   usr
block  crypto  drivers        include  io_uring  Kbuild  kernel   Makefile  net  scripts  sound




2.What folder likely contains USB driver code?

USB driver code is in drivers/usb/



3.What folder has memory management code?

Memory management code is in mm/



4.What is the purpose of a Makefile in the kernel?

The Makefile tells the compiler how to turn your C files into a working kernel.it defines how the kernel and modules are compiled and linked and it organizes the build process across subsystems.



5.What does Kconfig do?

Provides configuration options for kernel features and dependencies, used by tools like make menuconfig.



6.Why is the kernel source divided into many folders?

The kernel is split into folders (drivers, mm, fs, etc.) to keep code modular and maintainable.



7.Can we remove features from the kernel before building? How?

Yes, you can remove features before building by configuring the kernel with make menuconfig.



8.Why should we avoid modifying the top-level kernel Makefile directly?

Direct edits may break the entire kernel build process. Instead, changes should be made in subsystem Makefiles or Kconfig files. This preserves stability and compatibility with the kernel build system.

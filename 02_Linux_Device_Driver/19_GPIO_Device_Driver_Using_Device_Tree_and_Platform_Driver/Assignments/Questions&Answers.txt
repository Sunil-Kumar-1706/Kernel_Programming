1.What does GPIOD_OUT_LOW do?

It tells the kernel to configure the GPIO as an output pin.

It initializes the pin to a low state (0 volts, OFF) when acquired.

Used in gpiod_get(dev, NULL, GPIOD_OUT_LOW) to safely get the GPIO for output





2.Why must you call gpiod_put() in remove()?

Releases the GPIO descriptor and frees resources.

Prevents resource leaks or conflicts if another driver tries to use the GPIO later

Makes it safe to unload the driver.





3.What happens if the GPIO pin is not defined in the DT?

gpiod_get() will fail and return an error pointer.

The probe() function will detect this (IS_ERR()) and return an error.

The driver will not bind, and the LED cannot be controlled





4.How can you toggle an LED from the driver at runtime?

Use gpiod_set_value() to set the GPIO high or low:

gpiod_set_value(led_gpiod, 1); // ON
gpiod_set_value(led_gpiod, 0); // OFF





5.What does gpio-desc mean?

It’s a kernel object representing a GPIO pin.

Abstracts the pin so drivers don’t need to know the physical number or bank.

Allows uniform GPIO access via gpiod_get(), gpiod_set_value(), gpiod_get_value(), etc.

Safer and more portable than using raw GPIO numbers

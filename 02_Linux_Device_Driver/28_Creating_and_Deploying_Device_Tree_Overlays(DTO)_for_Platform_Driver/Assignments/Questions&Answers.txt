1.What file format is .dtbo?
.dtbo is a compiled Device Tree Overlay file.
It is a binary format generated from a .dts source file.
It is used to dynamically modify or extend the base device tree at runtime.
It allows hardware configuration without rebuilding the kernel.




2.What's the purpose of __overlay__?
overlay is used inside a .dts overlay to specify which nodes or properties will be added or modified in the base device tree.
It tells the kernel that this section should be merged on top of an existing node.
It enables flexible hardware configuration.
It helps avoid changing the base device tree file directly.




3.Why must compatible match exactly?
The compatible string identifies which driver should bind to the device.
If the string does not match exactly, the kernel will not find a matching driver.
The device will not be initialized properly.
Accurate matching ensures the correct driver is loaded.




4.What's the result of incorrect GPIO numbers?
Incorrect GPIO numbers cause the driver to access the wrong hardware pins.
This leads to failures like buttons not working or LEDs not lighting.
It can also cause unintended hardware behavior.
Debugging becomes harder due to mismatched pin configurations.




5.Can multiple DTOs be loaded simultaneously?
Yes, multiple Device Tree Overlays can be loaded at the same time.
Each overlay modifies different or compatible parts of the device tree.
Care must be taken to avoid conflicts in nodes and resources.
This allows modular and flexible hardware configuration.

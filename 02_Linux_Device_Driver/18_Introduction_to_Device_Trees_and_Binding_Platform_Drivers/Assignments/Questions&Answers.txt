1.What is the role of the compatible string?

Acts as a link between a Device Tree node and its driver.

Kernel uses it to match DT nodes to drivers via of_match_table.

Ensures the correct driver is loaded for a specific hardware device.






2.What happens if status = "disabled" in the DT?

Kernel ignores the DT node.

No platform device is created for that node.

Driverâ€™s probe() function is not called.






3.How does the kernel associate the DT node to a platform device?

Kernel reads the DT at boot and finds nodes with status = "okay".

Creates a platform device for each active node.

Matches the device to a driver using the compatible string.






4.Can one driver match multiple compatible strings?

Yes, a driver can list multiple entries in its of_device_id table.

Allows support for different versions or variants of a device.

Kernel matches any of the listed strings to the driver.





5.What does of_property_read_u32() do?

Reads a 32-bit integer property from a DT node.

Copies the value into a C variable.

Returns an error if the property does not exist.

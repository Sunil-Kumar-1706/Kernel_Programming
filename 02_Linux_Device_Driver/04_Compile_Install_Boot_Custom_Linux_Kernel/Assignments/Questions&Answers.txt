1. Write down what these commands do:

make menuconfig :

Opens a text-based menu to configure kernel options. 

You can enable, disable, or modularize features. 

Saves choices into a .config file used for building.


make -j$(nproc) :

Compiles the kernel using all available CPU cores ($(nproc) = number of cores). 

The -j speeds up the build by parallelizing jobs. 

This builds the kernel image and modules.


make modules_install :

Installs all compiled kernel modules into /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/. 

This makes them available for loading with modprobe or at boot.


make install :

Installs the kernel image, System.map, and config to /boot/. 

It also updates bootloader entries (like GRUB) automatically.


update-grub :

Regenerates the GRUB bootloader configuration file (usually /boot/grub/grub.cfg).

Ensures the new kernel appears as a boot option


uname -r :

Prints the version of the currently running kernel






2. After booting: 



a) What does uname -r show before your new kernel? 

it shows the version of the currently installed distribution kernel 6.8.0-84-generic




b) What does it show after?

It shows 6.8.0-custom







3. Open this file:

less /boot/grub/grub.cfg




a) How many kernels are listed under menuentry?

2 kernels are listed under menuentry




b) Which is the default?

6.8.0-84-generic this is the default




c) How can you manually choose which one to boot?

Hold Shift (for BIOS) or Esc (for UEFI) while the computer starts.

Use the arrow keys to move up or down and select the kernel you want.

Press Enter to boot that kernel.

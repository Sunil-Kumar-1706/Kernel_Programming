1. What’s the difference between major and minor numbers?

The major number identifies the driver associated with the device.

The minor number identifies a specific device or instance that the driver controls.

In simple terms, the major number tells the kernel which driver to use, while the minor number tells which device that driver should talk to.

Example: Multiple devices using the same driver will share the same major number but have different minor numbers.

Together, the major and minor numbers form a unique device identifier.






2. Why do we use container_of() in open()?

The container_of() macro is used to get the address of the parent structure from a pointer to one of its members.

In device drivers, when we call open(), we usually receive a pointer to struct file which contains a pointer to struct cdev.

Using container_of(), we can retrieve the pointer to our custom device structure that contains the cdev.

This helps us access the device’s private data and resources from within the open() function.

It ensures that each open call operates on the correct device instance.






3. What happens if two devices share the same buffer[]?

If two devices share the same buffer without synchronization, data corruption or race conditions can occur.

Both devices could try to read or write the buffer at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.

Each device should ideally have its own separate buffer to store and manage data independently.

If a shared buffer must be used, proper locking mechanisms such as mutexes or spinlocks are required to ensure thread safety.

Sharing buffers without protection breaks data isolation and can cause system instability.






4. How does private_data help isolate devices?

The private_data field in struct file is used to store a pointer to device-specific data.

When a device file is opened, the driver can assign its own data structure to file->private_data.

This allows each open device instance to maintain its own context or state information.

Different devices or users can use the same driver code but still work with independent data.

It prevents conflicts between multiple devices handled by the same driver.






5. What is MKDEV() and why is it needed?

MKDEV() is a macro that combines a major number and a minor number into a single dev_t value.

This dev_t value uniquely represents a device inside the kernel.

It is required when registering a device using functions like register_chrdev_region() or alloc_chrdev_region().

The kernel uses MKDEV() to identify the exact device based on its major and minor numbers.

Similarly, macros like MAJOR() and MINOR() can extract the major and minor parts from a dev_t value.

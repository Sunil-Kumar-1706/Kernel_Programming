1. What is the Linux kernel?

The Linux kernel is the core part of the operating system.

It connects hardware (CPU, memory, devices) with software (apps, programs).

It controls processes, memory, devices, and system calls.


2. What is a kernel module?

A kernel module is a piece of code that can be added to or removed from the kernel while it is running.

Example: a driver for a USB device or a file system.

You don’t need to rebuild or restart the whole kernel to use it.


3. Why should beginners use a VM for kernel experiments?

If you make a mistake in kernel programming, your computer can crash or freeze.

In a Virtual Machine (VM), the damage stays inside the VM, not your main computer.

You can quickly restart or take snapshots.


4. What is the purpose of the /proc folder?

/proc is a virtual filesystem that shows information about the running system and kernel.

It doesn’t contain real files on disk, but files generated by the kernel.

Examples:

/proc/cpuinfo → info about CPU

/proc/meminfo → info about memory

/proc/[pid] → info about a specific process


 Open the /dev folder and try to guess:
5. Which files are related to your hard drive?

Usually named like:

/dev/sda, /dev/sdb → whole disks

/dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1 → disk partitions

6. Which might belong to your keyboard or mouse?
Files for keyboard or mouse:
